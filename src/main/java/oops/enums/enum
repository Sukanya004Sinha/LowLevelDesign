it has a collection of CONSTANTS (variables which values can not be changed )
its CONSTANTS are static and final implicitly(WE DO NOT HAVE TO WRITE IT )
it cannot extend any classs as it internally extends java.lang.enum class
-it can implement interfaces
it can have variables, constructor, methods
it cannot be initiated ( as its constructor will e private only, even ypu can give default cit make it private)
No other classes can extend enum classes
it can  have abstract methods all the contants should implement that constants method
