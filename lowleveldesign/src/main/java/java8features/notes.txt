Functional Interfaces >
An interfaces which contains single abstract method is called functional interfaces

Following interface contains following methods
Runnable ==> run
Comparable ==> compare()
comparator==> compare()
ActionListener==> actionPerformed()
Callable==> call()

The main job of functional interface is to invoke lambda expression
the main job of functional interfaces are to call lambda expression
